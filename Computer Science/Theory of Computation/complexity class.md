## Complexity Class
Given the classes [[class of P|P]] and [[class of NP|NP]], we can determine that any member of class P is also a member of class NP. The class NPC (NP-Complete) are a subset of NP that are considered to be the most difficult problems in NP. 

### P = NP
Is $P = NP$? This is a famous open problem. If it is, they would collapse into one class. Most people think that $P \neq NP$.

### Theorems
$P \subseteq NP$. This means that either $P \subset NP$ or $P = NP$. This means that any [[Deterministic Turing Machine]] is a special case of a [[Nondeterministic Turing Machine]].
