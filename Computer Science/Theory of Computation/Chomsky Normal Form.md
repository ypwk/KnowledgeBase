## Chomsky Normal Form
Any nonempty [[context-free language]] without $\varepsilon$ has a [[context-free grammar]] $G$ in which all rules are in one of the following two forms:
- $A \rightarrow BC$
- $A \rightarrow a$
Where $A, B, C$ are nonterminals or variables, and $a$ is a terminal. 

One of the uses of Chomsky Normal Form is to turn parse trees into binary trees.
