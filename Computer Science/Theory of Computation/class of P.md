## Class of P

### Definition
P is the class of problems that are solvable in polynomial time by [[deterministic Turing Machine|deterministic turing machines]]. By polynomial time, we mean $O(n^c)$, where $n$ is input size, and $c$ is a constant. Problems in P are tractable. 

If a problem is not in P, it often requires unreasonably long time to solve for large-size inputs. P is independent of all models of computation, except the [[nondeterministic Turing Machine]].

### Examples
Some problems in P include Sorting, Searching, Selecting, Minimum Spanning Tree, Shortest Path, Matrix Multiplication, etc.
