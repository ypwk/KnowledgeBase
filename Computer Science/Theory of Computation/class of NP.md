## Class of NP

### Definition
NP is the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by [[nondeterministic Turing Machine|nondeterministic turing machines]], or in exponential time by [[deterministic Turing Machine|deterministic turing machines]].

### Theorems
Any problem $\Pi \in NP$ can be solved using a [[deterministic Turing Machine]] in time $O(c^{p(n)})$ for some $c > 0$ and polynomial $p(n)$.
