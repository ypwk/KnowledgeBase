## Church-Turing Thesis
States that any reasonable attempt to model algorithms and their time performance mathematically is bound to end up with a model of computation and associated time cost that is equivalent to [[Turing Machine|Turing machines]] within a polynomial.

In other words, we can model algorithms with Turing Machines.
