## Finite Automaton
Finite automata are the simplest computational models for computers with an extremely limited amount of memory.

Given an input string, a finite automaton reads the string, one symbol at a time, from left to right. Using a transition function, the Finite Automaton changes from one state to another based on what symbol is being read. Eventually, it reads all symbols in the string. If at this time the Finite Automaton enters a final state, then the Finite Automaton halts and the string is accepted.  

There are two types of finite automata: [[Deterministic Finite Automaton|deterministic finite automata]] and [[Nondeterministic Finite Automaton|nondeterministic finite automata]].
