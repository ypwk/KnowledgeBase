## Complexity Theory

The study of what can or cannot be computed efficiently by a [[Turing Machine]] or [[algorithm]], among all decidable or solvable problems.

The set of all solvable problems are further classified into various complexity classes based on the efficiency of algorithms that can solve these problems.

Complexity Theory is the study of the definition and properties of this class.
