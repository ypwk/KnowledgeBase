## Characteristic Polynomial
If we take the [[eigenvalue-eigenvector equation]], we can do the following:
$$
\begin{align}
	&Ax = \lambda x \\ 
	&\lambda x - Ax = 0 \\
	&det(\lambda I - A) = 0
\end{align}
$$
We define $p_A(t)$, the characteristic equation for $A$, to be $det(tI - A) = 0$. The roots of this equation are the [[eigenvalue|eigenvalues]] of $A$. In other words, the roots of the characteristic equation coincide with the [[spectrum]] of $A$, $\sigma(A)$.
