## Matrix
A rectangular array of numbers in the following format, indexed by rows and columns. A $m \times n$ matrix $A = (a_{ij})$ is indexed as follows: 
$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
		a_{11} & a_{12} & \dots  & \dots  & a_{1n} \\
		a_{21} & \ddots &        &        & \vdots \\
		\vdots &        & a_{ij} &        & \vdots \\
		\vdots &        &        & \ddots & \vdots \\
		a_{m1} & \dots  & \dots  & \dots  & a_{mn} 
	\end{bmatrix}
$$
The $a_{ij}$ entry appears on the $i^{\text{th}}$ row and the $j^{\text{th}}$ column. 

We can represent a square matrix $A$ as follows: $A \in M_n(\mathbb{F})$, where $\mathbb{F}$ is the field that the entries of the matrix are taken over.
