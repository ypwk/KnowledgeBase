## Eigenvector
Given a square matrix $A \in M_n$, an eigenvector of $A$, $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$, is a nonzero vector that satisfies the eigenvalue-eigenvector equation: $Ax = \lambda x$, where $\lambda$ is the [[eigenvalue]] and $x \neq 0$ is the eigenvector. 

Note that the eigenvector of a matrix remains an eigenvector of that matrix after scalar multiplication.
