## Trace
For a square matrix $A \in M_n$ with diagonal entries $a_{ii}$, the trace of $A$ is the sum of its diagonal entries.  $$tr(A)=\sum^{n}_{i=0}a_{ii}$$
In general, the trace of $A$ is equal to the sum of the [[eigenvalue|eigenvalues]] of $A$. If the [[eigenvalue|eigenvalues]] of A are $\lambda_i$:
$$tr(A)=\sum^{n}_{i=0}\lambda_i$$
